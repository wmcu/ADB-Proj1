3. How to Run:
To run our program, execute the following command:

	$python main.py <bing account key> <precision> <query>

<bing account key>: our Bing Search Account Key
<precision>: the target value for precision@10, a real between 0 and 1
<query>: your query, a list of words in single quotes(e.g. 'taj mahal')

4. Workflow:
a. Receive inputs: bing account key, a query and a precision value.
b. Retrive the top-10 query results from Bing, and collect user's feedback.
c. Calculate precision, and expand query if desired presicion not reached.
d. Otherwise go to step b.

5. Algorithm for expanding query:
a. Rocchio algorithm
We followed Rocchio algorithm to calculate weights of words in query results.
First, we collect every word from relevant results into a positive list,
and word from irrelevant results into a negative list. Then weight of each
unique word is calulated by: weight(word) = f_pos(word) - f_neg(word),
where f_pos returns the word frequency in positive list, f_neg returns the word
frequency in negative list. The "word frequency" in a list means the number
of appearance divided by total length of list; if no appearance, word frequency
is defined as 0.0.

b. Choose words to expand query
After each feedback round, one word with highest weight is appended to query
word list. However, "stop words" words are skipped, as is explained in next
point. We decided to add only word to because second word can have much lower
weight than first word and thus bring in noise. Also, we make sure there are
no two words only different in case appear in query word list.

c. stop words list
Certain "stop words", like "a", "the", are prevented being appended to query.
In that way, even high-weighted stop words will not be included in query.

d. Non english character filter
The Bing serch result can contains some non-english word characters,
like "..." and quotes. These characters are removed before being added to
positive/negative word list.

7. An interesting phenomenon:
We test our program from different places and the result from Bing search can
vary from place to place. We guess this is caused by some kind of geography or
ISP based mechanism from Bing.
